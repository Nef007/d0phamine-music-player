## Functionality 🥹

1. **Very important** - its just play your saved music
2. Can save your favorite locations on your computer
3. At the end, have all player functions with looping and shuffling.

*Yes it looks simple, but I will continue to work on it and add new cool features, believe me!!!*

## My thoughts for the future

1. Adding custom playlists (with location independent tracks)
2. Custom user themes
3. Visualiser of music (I'll think about it)
4. Maybe EQ
